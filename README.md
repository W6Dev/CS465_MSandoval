## Architecture

### Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).

Single Page Applications (SPAs) offer a distinct advantage over traditional static HTML sites in terms of design consistency. With SPAs, elements like colors, fonts, headers, and footers are centrally managed, ensuring a uniform look across views. In contrast, each page of a static site requires individual updates.
Angular and Express serve different sides of web development. Angular operates on the client-side, while Express functions server-side. This distinction becomes particularly evident during debugging. With Express, transaction logs and errors typically appear in the PowerShell, whereas Angular-related issues are often diagnosed using the browser's inspector.


### Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?

NoSQL databases provide many benefits in a simple website like Travlr. First is the cost, MongoDB can be implemented for free whereas Microsoft SQL Server can cost thousands of dollars for licensing. Second is the NoSQL is not relational and no database schema needs to be designed, this could save hundreds of hours in development time. The ad hoc nature of MongoDB is well suited for simple websites.

## Functionality

### How is JSON different from JavaScript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?

JSON is file format that is used to transfer data between application such as frontend and backend elements.  JSON is only used to store data where JavaScript is a programming language that can perform tasks.

### Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.

I refactored one of the routes to clearly identify the difference between another route.

## Testing

### Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.

Testing was primarily done with the Postman application. Post facilitates direct interactions with the API, allowing developers to execute GET and PUT requests. By communicating directly, developers can isolate potential issues, ensuring the integrity of commands sent and data received. Postman's ability to show raw return data further aids the debugging process.

## Reflection

### How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?

The course will be important for my future. As technology changes, web apps are becoming more popular. Windows is not as dominate as it once was, many people use Macs or even android devices in their everyday life. Web application are cross platform, allow for the same functionality no matter which OS the end user is using. Mastering full-stack development will guide my path to becoming a future software developer.
